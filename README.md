Vehicle Detection and Tracking Application Overview This project, developed by Group 5, is a real-time object detection and tracking application using the YOLOv8 model. It is designed for tasks such as road safety, surveillance, and medical assistance, focusing on detecting and tracking vehicles (e.g., ambulances, cars, buses). The application features an interactive web interface built with Streamlit, video processing with OpenCV, and heatmap generation for visualization. Features

Real-time detection and tracking of objects in videos. Customizable selection of object classes (e.g., cars, ambulances). Optional emergency vehicle detection based on color and audio cues. Generation of heatmaps and downloadable PDF reports/CSV logs. Support for uploaded videos and sample videos.

Installation Prerequisites

Python 3.8 or higher Git (for cloning the repository)

Steps

Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/ton-utilisateur/your-depot.git cd your-depot

Install the required dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txt

Ensure the YOLOv8 model file (yolov8n.pt) is in the project directory or adjust the path in detector.py.

Usage

Run the application:streamlit run app.py

Use the web interface to: Upload a video or select a sample video. Choose object classes to detect. Enable/disable emergency mode. View real-time results and download reports.
